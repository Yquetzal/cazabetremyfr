# Project

For the capstone project of this class, you will work collaboratively in groups of 2 to 3 students to explore blockchain network and produce a data analysis report.

You can find the project description [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fHUsrbJzU73xZ0yLbEeFK6jE3agPvTqzrFt2BThNIeI/edit).

# Datasets
### Here are some network datasets to play with:

(Use right-click, download as, **file_name.graphml** )

* [GOT](http://cazabetremy.fr/Teaching/CN2021/dataset/GOT.graphml): small network of interactions between caracters in the Game of Thrones Book series
* [airports](http://cazabetremy.fr/Teaching/CN2021/dataset/airportsAndCoord.graphml): medium network of airline connetions between airports

------
# Tools
### Gephi
Gephi is a software for basic graph manipulation and visualization. Although you can't do much in term of graph analytics, it is convenient to explore and visualize graphs of small to medium size ( < 1000 nodes). 
It can be donwloaded there: [Gephi](http://gephi.org). 

### Python
Most of the experiments are done in python. If you're not familiar with this language, there are numerous tutorials on the web. A good one for instance is from w3schools. If you want to be all set-up for experiments, here is a list of packages we will use. Note that if you want, it can be simpler to use an online tool such as [google colab](https://colab.research.google.com)
* networkx. Generic network analysis
* notebook. Jupyter notebook
* cdlib. Community detection
* scikit-learn. Machine learning/Data mining
* seaborn. ploting library
