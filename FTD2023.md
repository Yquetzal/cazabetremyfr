# Datasets
### Here are some network datasets to play with:
(Use right-click, download as, **file_name.graphml** )
* http://cazabetremy.fr/Teaching/CN2021/dataset/GOT.graphml: small network of interactions between caracters in the Game of Thrones Book series
* http://cazabetremy.fr/Teaching/CN2020/airportsAndCoord.graphml: medium network of airline connetions between airports with location and country

# Tools
### Gephi
Gephi is a software for basic graph manipulation and visualization. Although you can't do much in term of graph analytics, it is convenient to explore and visualize graphs of small to medium size ( < 1000 nodes). 
It can be donwloaded there : [Gephi](http://gephi.org). 

### Python
Most of the experiments are done in python. If you're not familiar with this language, there are numerous tutorials on the web. A good one for instance is from w3schools. If you want to be all set-up for experiments, here is a list of packages we will use. Note that if you want, it can be simpler to use an online tool such as [google colab](https://colab.research.google.com)
* networkx. Generic network analysis
* notebook. Jupyter notebook
* cdlib. Community detection
* scikit-learn. Machine learning/Data mining
* seaborn. ploting library
